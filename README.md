## 👤 Where Faces Tell a Story!

FaceInsight is an AI-powered facial analysis tool designed to detect and analyze human emotions, age, and gender from images. Utilizing OpenCV for face detection and DeepFace for deep learning-based emotion recognition, the system provides insightful data on human expressions. This technology can be used in various applications, including mental health monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and interactive AI systems.


## 🌟 **Core Features**
- **🧑‍🦰 Face Detection:** Uses OpenCV’s Haarcascade classifier to detect human faces in images.
- **😊 Emotion Analysis:**  Identifies dominant emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and neutral
- **👦 Age Estimation:**  Predicts the approximate age of the detected person.
- **✅ Gender Classification:**  Determines the gender along with a confidence percentage.


## 🔜 **Coming Soon**
- **📷 Live Camera Integration:** Enable real-time emotion detection via webcam.
- **👥  Multiple Face Detection Toggle:** Allow users to choose whether to detect one or multiple faces.


## 🔧 **Technology Stack**

- **Backend**:
  - 🐍 Python (Core programming language)
  - 🤖 DeepFace (For deep learning-based facial analysis)
  - 🖼️ OpenCV (For face detection and image processing)
  - ➗ NumPy (For handling image arrays and numerical computations)

- **Frontend**:
  - 📊 Matplotlib (For visualizing processed images)
  - 💻 Google Colab Interface (For running the project interactively)
  - ✂️ PIL (Pillow) (For image handling and processing)


## 💻 **Usage Instructions**
1️⃣ Upload an image using the upload function in Google Colab.
2️⃣ The system detects the face and analyzes emotion, age, and gender.
3️⃣ The processed image is displayed with labeled results in red text.
4️⃣ Results can be saved or used for further applications.
